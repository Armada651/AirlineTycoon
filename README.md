# AirlineTycoon

This repository completes the partial source code that is provided as a free bonus in the GOG release
of Airline Tycoon Deluxe. To run it you'll need the game assets from either the Deluxe or Evolution edition
of the game. You can purchase these assets from GOG.com: https://www.gog.com/game/airline_tycoon_deluxe

The code in the repository is licensed under the terms included in the GOG release. As such the code can
only be used for non-commercial purposes and remains property of BFG.

It is therefore *not* open-source in the free software sense, for more information refer to the License.txt.

## What works?

The full singleplayer game should be playable with only a few minor issues.

Network multiplayer support will be added soon.

## Building

This repository can only be successfully built using Visual C++ 6.0, which is a version of Visual Studio from the 90s.

More build instructions will follow soon.
